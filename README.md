## 📌 Project Description

The Student Score Predictor uses Machine Learning to estimate a student's final exam score. The model considers factors like study habits and academic history. 

This project is beginner-friendly and built with Python and Scikit-learn. You can easily understand how different factors affect a student's performance.

### 🧠 Objective

The goal is to create a model that can predict a student’s performance based on:

- 📚 Study Hours
- 😴 Sleep Hours
- 🏫 Attendance Percentage
- 📝 Previous Exam Score

### 📊 Machine Learning Models Used

We trained two regression models:

1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest Regressor 🌲

The model that performs best is saved and ready for future predictions.

### 📚 Dataset Information

The dataset contains synthetic student performance data. Here’s what each feature represents:

| Feature           | Description                              |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `study_hours`     | Number of hours studied per day          |
| `sleep_hours`     | Average sleep hours per night            |
| `attendance`      | Attendance percentage                     |
| `previous_score`  | Score from the previous exam             |
| `final_score`     | Final exam score (this is the target variable) |
